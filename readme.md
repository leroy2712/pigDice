# Leroy Omondi

PigDice one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. The player can choose to "roll dice" or pass turn. If the player rolls dice, they stand to gain points. If they "pass turn", they forfeit their turn and could risk losing the game.
